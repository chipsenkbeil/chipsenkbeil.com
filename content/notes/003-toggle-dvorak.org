In my ArchLinux setup with XMonad, I've found myself wanting to swap between
/QWERTY/ and /Dvorak/ keyboard layouts when practicing /Dvorak/. While my
/Kinesis Advantage/ keyboard allows me to swap layouts at the hardware level
(I'm assuming by simulating Dvorak on top of Qwerty), I also found a
keyboard-agnostic way to do this.

* Configuring Keypress Toggle

For X11, create the following configuration at
=/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf=:

#+begin_src sh
# Read and parsed by systemd-localed. It's probably wise not to edit this file
# manually too freely.
Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "system-keyboard"
    MatchIsKeyboard "on"
    Option "XkbLayout" "us,us"
    Option "XkbModel" ","
    Option "XkbVariant" ",dvorak"
    Option "XkbOptions" "grp:toggle"
EndSection
#+end_src

This enables toggling Dvorak via =Right-Alt=.

* Configuring Visual Indicator with Xmobar

So, along with XMonad, I use Xmobar to display useful information such as my
current workspace, battery charge, and time. To avoid confusing myself when
switching between keyboard layouts, I added a visual indicator in the right
corner of Xmobar via the following:

#+begin_src haskell
-- Display of Xmobar information
, template = "%StdinReader%  }{ %battery% | %multicpu% | %coretemp% | %memory% | %dynnetwork% | %KAUS% | %date% || %kbd% "

, commands =
    [
    -- Series of commands to run on Xmobar
    -- ...

    -- keyboard layout indicator
    , Run Kbd            [ ("us(dvorak)" , "<fc=#00008B>DV</fc>")
                         , ("us"         , "<fc=#8B0000>US</fc>")
                         ]
    ]
#+end_src
