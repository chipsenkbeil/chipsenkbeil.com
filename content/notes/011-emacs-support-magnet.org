If you're using homebrew, you'd normally install the GUI Emacs application via

#+begin_example
brew cask install emacs
#+end_example

The problem is that this installs the standard GNU Emacs leveraging some basic
Cocoa GUI, which results in the [[https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/][Magnet]]
application not being able to snap Emacs to any of its grids. If you look at the
Magnet dropdown with Emacs focused, all of the options will be greyed out.

As described in
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/8ez3a9/macos_window_snapping_with_magnetdoesnt_work_on/][this reddit post]], there is an Emacs distribution designed specifically for Mac OS X
that adds
[[https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/src/f3402395995bf70e50d6e65f841e44d5f9b4603c/README-mac?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default][additional features]] through a Carbon port (over Cocoa from default homebrew).

Installing this version can be done via

#+begin_example
brew cask install railwaycat/emacsmacport/emacs-mac
#+end_example

As of writing this note, Emacs 26.3 is installed and works well with Magnet
2.4.5 on Mac OS X 10.15.3.
