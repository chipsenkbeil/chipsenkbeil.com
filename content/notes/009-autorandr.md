I have successfully moved over to using super ultrawide monitors both at work
  ([Dell U4919DW][dell]) and at home ([Samsung CRG90][samsung] + [CalDigit TS3
  Plus][caldigit]). I've set these up as one-cable solutions over USB-C via
  Alternate Mode (Dell) and/or Thunderbolt 3 (Samsung + CalDigit), which makes
  my life much easier.
