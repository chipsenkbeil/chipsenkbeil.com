Couple of notes about searching on Github that have proven to be quite useful:

1. You can include/exclude specific files using the =filename= property in a
   search.

   The following searches for content /"some content"/ only in =.config= files.

   #+begin_example
   some content filename:.config
   #+end_example

   The following searches for content /"some content"/ in all files but
   =.config= files.

   #+begin_example
   some content -filename:.config
   #+end_example

2. You can include/exclude specific users and organizations in a search. This is
   handy when I'm trying to judge how much use a library of mine is getting in
   the open source community while avoiding my own projects.

   The following excludes matches in the specified users/organizations.

   #+begin_example
   scala-debugger -user:ensime -user:chipsenkbeil
   #+end_example
