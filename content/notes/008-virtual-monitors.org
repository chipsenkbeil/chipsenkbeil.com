I recently learned that you can configure virtual monitors with xrandr. There
are two different ways to use this: treat multiple physical monitors as one
giant virtual monitor or treat one physical monitor as multiple virtual
monitors.

Note that this requires xrandr 1.5.0 or higher, which introduces setmonitor as
an option in the CLI.

** Why do I want to do this?
My primary interest here is to split a super widescreen monitor like the
[[https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-49-curved-monitor-u4919dw/apd/210-arnw/monitors-monitor-accessories][Dell
49‚Äù UltraSharp Curved Monitor (U4919DW)]] as multiple separate displays. I like
the way that dwm breaks up monitors into multiple spaces and when I have two or
three separate monitors I normally use a center monitor for focused work with
the side monitors containing music, calendar, and chat.

The idea here is to keep the same setup, but leverage an ultrawide monitor
rather than multiple physical monitors that require an eGPU to drive from a
laptop rather than plugging the laptop in directly.

** How do I do this?
[[https://askubuntu.com/a/998435][This post]] highlighted a means to do this
with xrandr 1.5+ virtual monitors.

Leveraging *xrandr* to print out your display information, you can create new
virtual monitors using =xrandr --setmonitor=.

On my laptop, the output of =xrandr= yielded:

#+begin_example
Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 8192 x 8192
eDP-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 309mm x 173mm
   1920x1080     60.01*+  59.97    59.96    59.93
   1680x1050     59.95    59.88
   1400x1050     59.98
   1600x900      59.99    59.94    59.95    59.82
   ...
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
DP-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-2 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
#+end_example

To split into left and right virtual monitors, I ran:

#+begin_example
xrandr --setmonitor eDP-1-1 960/154x1080/173+0+0 eDP-1
xrandr --setmonitor eDP-1-2 960/155x1080/173+960+0 none
#+end_example

Upon issuing the first command, the left side of my monitor became its own
entity and the right side was blank (as if unplugged). The second command added
a second monitor (picked up by dwm).

I was able to remove both monitors can get back to normal by running:

#+begin_example
xrandr --delmonitor eDP-1-2
xrandr --delmonitor eDP-1-1
#+end_example

The post mentioned above stated that the following commands were needed for
xrandr to refresh the changes, but they weren't required for me on a T480s with
Fedora 30:

#+begin_example
xrandr --fb 1921x1080
xrandr --fb 1920x1080
#+end_example
