Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss?
When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long
enough to finish a post? How do I understand if the post was a hit?

Interestingly enough, the challenges posed by those questions share
similarities with those that I've faced as a solutions engineer, and it's these
challenges and how I've approached tackling them that I'm going to discuss
here.

## New Role, New Responsibilities

When I first became a solutions engineer back in July of 2017, I wasn't sure
what I would actually be doing. At IBM, my work revolved around code 100% of
the time. I'd written Ruby on Rails applications to provide cloud cluster
management and remote desktop integration, contributed to Apache Spark,
architected and implemented an [IPython (now Jupyter) kernel][apache-toree]),
and worked on a [conversational computing platform][conversational-computing]
leveraging Watson technologies.

How did that transfer to my new position? The job description painted the role
as 50% coding and 50% non-technical work, but who can really say what that
means until you try out the job for yourself.  I landed in a team with a focus
on both scalability and client engagement, which you would think are opposites
given the personal nature of 

As I've learned, the role can
vary drastically in responsibilities and engagements based on your team, which
makes sense as the same would apply to a software engineering position.

What did all of this mean for me? A couple of things:

1. I was client facing, meaning I would talk to advertisers directly where
   warranted
2. I had to design and build software at scale from both a technical and
   industry perspective (not tied to one industry where possible)
3. TODO

## Struggles

## What

What have I found since joining the SMB HV team? You have the freedom to define
your own schedule, and that includes what meetings you accept and how much of
your calendar you let fill up. I split my time between

"But the coding!" you shout. "What about the coding?" Coding time can rapidly
vary from week to week, at least for me.

discuss not just coding role
discuss involves lot of communication with a variety of roles and experiences
discuss goals shifted from building/designing; that is still important, but is
part of a means to an end (and good work is expected)

## Expectations

## Challenges

A couple of months into my new position, I found myself facing a slew of new
challenges impeding me from performing my best.

### Context Switching

When doing traditional software engineering, I was used to large blocks of time
being dedicated to single tasks. Given a new task, I could afford to spend
multiple hours at a time towards thinking through and implementing a solution
in one go. I could completely focus on the task at hand - getting
_into the zone_ - and not worry about frequent interruptions vying for my time.

After switching over to become a solutions engineer, I quickly realized that I no
longer had that luxury. Multiple projects with different technical stacks split
up my technical focus while other responsibilities - namely industry research,
cross-functional team collaboration, training & education preparation, client
and sales meetings, analyzing and formulating queries for data, etc. - ate up
the rest of my time.

I've been expected to handle a variety of different tasks, all of which are
vying for my attention and require different skills and mindsets to tackle.
This involved quite a lot of context switching, which prevented me from getting
_into the zone_ compared to my previous job.

### Parallel Work

As described above, my old work didn't require me to focus on too many tasks at
once.

### Prioritization

### Strengths & Weaknesses

discuss difficulties initially adapting
- many different items require parallel work
- context switching hurts focus
- hard to prioritize and evaluate time needed to accomplish tasks

## Understanding

TODO

write about quick work in building from scratch
write about slowness in integrating into existing projects; why is that?


## Planning

TODO

discuss panda planner and reference other time management videos
monthly, weekly, daily breakdown discussion
potentially show picture of planner

## Focus

TODO

discuss pomodoro technique and attempts to focus
block off time to prevent frequent intervals of disruptions

## Experiment

TODO

discuss need to never become fully complacent
- learn what works for you and keep doing that BUT
  - continue to evaluate if you can improve what you are doing that works
    e.g. I'm using panda planner, a physical notebook I need to keep around;
         is there a better way? I strong with Kanban Flow and other online
         tools; why is panda planner working so well for me? break down reasons
         and use to evaluate if other tools meet those and more
