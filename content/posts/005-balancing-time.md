Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss?
When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long
enough to finish a post? How do I understand if the post was a hit?

Interestingly enough, the challenges posed by those questions share
similarities with those that I've faced as a solutions engineer, and it's these
challenges and how I've approached tackling them that I want to discuss now.

## New Role, New Responsibilities

### I previously did a lot of technical stuff

When I first became a solutions engineer back in July of 2017, I wasn't sure
what I would actually be doing. At IBM, my work revolved around code 100% of
the time. I'd written Ruby on Rails applications to provide cloud cluster
management and remote desktop integration, contributed
[several][apache-spark-1] [times][apache-spark-2] to Apache Spark, architected
and implemented an [IPython (now Jupyter) kernel][apache-toree]), and worked on
a [conversational computing platform][conversational-computing] leveraging
Watson technologies.

### The new role said 50/50 technical & non-technical

The job description painted the role as 50% coding and 50% non-technical work,
but who can really say what that means until you try out the job for yourself.
I landed in a team with a focus on both scalability and client engagement,
which you would think are opposites given the personal nature of client
engagement and the abstract focus that scalability demands.

In actuality, these two focuses are intertwined. By __understanding__ the
challenges that clients are facing on the platform and in the industry, we as
solutions engineers are in the unique position to identify and engage in
solutions at a faster pace and with more detailed attention to client needs
than any other engineering team. Combining with my team's need to __scale__ our
solutions across (ideally) thousands of advertisers, the solutions we build
need to function at a minimum across entire industries like ecommerce or retail
with the preferred approach being to create solutions that can span across
multiple industries.

### Is that breakdown honest?

Switching back to the technical/non-technical breakdown, the 50% split is
somewhat accurate, but not from the scope of week-to-week. Rather, I have
certain days at a time where 80-100% of my time is spent in meetings,
supporting external clients strategically, researching trends in industry,
planning out initiatives, and handling other non-technical responsibilities. On
the flip side, I've had entire days where I've done nothing but write code,
diving deep into understanding an existing technical stack, building out
full-stack applications for internal tools, or adding enhancements to our
existing public interfaces.

Each team under solutions engineering is a little different with some teams
having minimal client interaction while others like mine deal with a large
volume of different clients on a weekly basis.

### What technologies have I leveraged?

Focusing on the technical, I've spent my time building frontends leveraging
[Flow][flow], [React][reactjs], and variations of [Flux][flux] (although I've
also got my eye on [ReasonML][reasonml]); designing and implementing backend
systems in [Hack][hack]; creating data pipelines using our internal systems and
a mixture of [Python][python]; and architecting and building a system
leveraging __machine learning technologies__.

As with the breakdown described earlier, your work can vary depending on which
specific team you are on within solutions engineering. If you are more heavily
involved with gaming, your focus could be more centered around mobile
application development and enhancements to our SDKs, while an
ecommerce-centric approach would require a lot more web-based development.

## Challenges & Solutions

I've tried to do my best to describe a little bit about my new role. The
experiences and

### Swarmed by different responsibilities

When doing traditional software engineering, I was accustom to large blocks of
time being dedicated to single tasks. Given a new task, I could afford to spend
multiple hours at a time towards thinking through and implementing a solution
in one go. I could completely focus on the task at hand - getting _into the
zone_ - and not worry about frequent interruptions vying for my time.

After switching over to become a solutions engineer, I quickly realized that I no
longer had that luxury. Multiple projects with different technical stacks split
up my technical focus while other responsibilities - namely industry research,
cross-functional team collaboration, training & education preparation, client
and sales meetings, analyzing and formulating queries for data, etc. - ate up
the rest of my time.

I've been expected to handle a variety of different tasks, all of which want my
attention and require different skills and mindsets to tackle. This involved
quite a lot of context switching, which prevented me from getting _into the
zone_ compared to my previous job.

...

How do I keep track of all the different responsibilities I have?

### Prioritization is hard

Context switching can be deadly as an engineer, slowing down or even halting
progress towards completing projects. If I wasn't careful, my work could
quickly lead down a road of unproductivity and frustration.

...

How do I ensure that I'm spending my time on the right projects?

###

...

Is there a way to make sure that I'm making progress on multiple initiatives at
once?


## Solutions

### Understanding my strengths & weaknesses

...
discuss that strengths are just what you do quickly
weaknesses aren't just what you don't do quickly

### Addressing the "too many tasks" challenge

...
discuss dumping brain onto paper (list panda planner and bullet journal)

discuss panda planner and reference other time management videos
monthly, weekly, daily breakdown discussion
potentially show picture of planner

### Improving prioritization

...
evaluate by impact and time
check in with manager to get another perspective

Ask questions like
Should I be doing this? Or is this meant for someone else?
Is this something I can do quickly in five minutes or less? Or is it more
involved?

### What happens at work, stays at work

...
Cite other things I'm doing like workouts, art class, agility training, coffee
nights, grad school

## Retrospective

1. Things are working well
2. I feel less stressed at work
3. I'm learning a lot
