Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss?
When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long
enough to finish a post?

Interestingly enough, the challenges underlined by those questions overlap with
those that I've faced as a solutions engineer, and it's those challenges and
how I've approached tackling them that I'm going to try to summarize here.

## Expectations

When I first became a solutions engineer back in July of 2017, I wasn't sure
what would be expected of me. At IBM, success stemmed from a mixture of my
contributions to engineering projects and my technical leadership. Pushing
forward better coding practices, designing robust architectures, and writing
fault-tolerant and scalable code was my bread and butter.

How did that transfer to my new position? The job description painted the role
as 50% coding and 50% non-technical work, but who can really say what that
means until you try out the job for yourself. From what I've experienced thus
far, a solutions engineer has the same coding expectations that I was familiar
with from IBM
Lo and behold, my new position as a solutions engineer involved all of those
expectations and much more. From

discuss not just coding role
discuss involves lot of communication with a variety of roles and experiences
discuss goals shifted from building/designing; that is still important, but is
part of a means to an end (and good work is expected)

## Challenges

A couple of months into my new position, I found myself facing a slew of new
challenges impeding me from performing my best.

### Context Switching

When doing traditional software engineering, I was used to large blocks of time
being dedicated to single tasks. Given a new task, I could afford to dedicate
multiple hours at a time towards thinking through and implementing a solution
in one go. I could dedicate my complete focus to the task at hand - getting
_into the zone_ - and not worry about frequent interruptions vying for my time.

After I switched over to a solutions engineer, I quickly realized that I no
longer had that luxury. What's that, you need me to implement a new React
application to enable the sales team to better understand the needs of their
clients? Sure, I can do that, just let me - oh, what's that? I need to write a
training document to teach retail-focused sales team members about some of our
new product offerings? Okay, but what do you want me to do about - oh, the CMO
of your biggest client is having a meeting right now and it's critical that a
solutions engineer joins the call? Uh, well, I....

The point illustrated above is that - as a solutions engineer - I've been
expected to handle a variety of different tasks, all of which are vying for my
attention and require different skills and mindsets to tackle. This involved
quite a lot of context switching, which prevented me from getting _into the
zone_ compared to my previous job.

### Parallel Work

As described above, my old work didn't require me to focus on too many tasks at
once.

### Prioritization

### Strengths & Weaknesses

discuss difficulties initially adapting
- many different items require parallel work
- context switching hurts focus
- hard to prioritize and evaluate time needed to accomplish tasks

## Understanding

TODO

write about quick work in building from scratch
write about slowness in integrating into existing projects; why is that?


## Planning

TODO

discuss panda planner and reference other time management videos
monthly, weekly, daily breakdown discussion
potentially show picture of planner

## Focus

TODO

discuss pomodoro technique and attempts to focus
block off time to prevent frequent intervals of disruptions

## Experiment

TODO

discuss need to never become fully complacent
- learn what works for you and keep doing that BUT
  - continue to evaluate if you can improve what you are doing that works
    e.g. I'm using panda planner, a physical notebook I need to keep around;
         is there a better way? I strong with Kanban Flow and other online
         tools; why is panda planner working so well for me? break down reasons
         and use to evaluate if other tools meet those and more
