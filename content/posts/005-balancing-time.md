Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss?
When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long
enough to finish a post?

Interestingly enough, the challenges underlined by those questions overlap with
those that I've faced as a solutions engineer and it's those challenges and how
I've approached tackling them that I'm going to try to summarize here.

## Expectations

When I first became a solutions engineer back in July of 2017, I wasn't sure
what would be expected of me. At IBM, success stemmed from a mixture of my
contribution to engineering projects and my technical leadership. Pushing
forward better coding practices, designing robust architectures, and writing
fault-tolerant and scalable code was my bread and butter.

Lo and behold, my new position as a solutions engineer involved all of those
expectations and much more. From

discuss not just coding role
discuss involves lot of communication with a variety of roles and experiences
discuss goals shifted from building/designing; that is still important, but is
part of a means to an end (and good work is expected)

## Challenges

A couple of months into my new position, I found myself facing a slew of new
challenges impeding me from performing my best.

TODO

discuss difficulties initially adapting
- many different items require parallel work
- context switching hurts focus
- hard to prioritize and evaluate time needed to accomplish tasks

## Understanding

TODO

write about quick work in building from scratch
write about slowness in integrating into existing projects; why is that?


## Planning

TODO

discuss panda planner and reference other time management videos
monthly, weekly, daily breakdown discussion
potentially show picture of planner

## Focus

TODO

discuss pomodoro technique and attempts to focus
block off time to prevent frequent intervals of disruptions

## Experiment

TODO

discuss need to never become fully complacent
- learn what works for you and keep doing that BUT
  - continue to evaluate if you can improve what you are doing that works
    e.g. I'm using panda planner, a physical notebook I need to keep around;
         is there a better way? I strong with Kanban Flow and other online
         tools; why is panda planner working so well for me? break down reasons
         and use to evaluate if other tools meet those and more
