Writing blog posts is hard, at least for me. What is a good topic to discuss?
When can I find the time to write the content? How can I stay focused long
enough to finish a post?

Interestingly enough, the challenges underlined by those questions overlap with
those that I've faced as a solutions engineer, and it's those challenges and
how I've approached tackling them that I'm going to try to summarize here.

## New Role

When I first became a solutions engineer back in July of 2017, I wasn't sure
what I would actually be doing. At IBM, my work revolved around code 100% of
the time. I'd written Ruby on Rails applications, contributed to Apache Spark,
architected and implemented an IPython/Jupyter kernel ([Apache
Toree][apache-toree]), and worked on a [conversational computing
platform][conversational-computing] leveraging Watson technologies.

How did that transfer to my new position? The job description painted the role
as 50% coding and 50% non-technical work, but who can really say what that
means until you try out the job for yourself. As I've learned, the role can
vary drastically in responsibilities and engagements based on your team, which
makes sense as the same would apply to a software engineering position. I
landed in a team focused on engaging with clients under the umbrella of SMB HV.

- SMB stands for _small and medium (a.k.a. midsize) business_, and
  [Gartner's summary][smb] provides a good idea of the staff and annual
  revenue that encompasses.
- HV stands for _high value_ and is primarily used as a classification used
  within the company to separate low-spending advertisers (think $100 per
  month) from higher-spending advertisers.

What have I found since joining the SMB HV team? You have the freedom to define
your own schedule, and that includes what meetings you accept and how much of
your calendar you let fill up. I split my time between

"But the coding!" you shout. "What about the coding?" Coding time can rapidly
vary from week to week, at least for me.

discuss not just coding role
discuss involves lot of communication with a variety of roles and experiences
discuss goals shifted from building/designing; that is still important, but is
part of a means to an end (and good work is expected)

## Expectations

## Challenges

A couple of months into my new position, I found myself facing a slew of new
challenges impeding me from performing my best.

### Context Switching

When doing traditional software engineering, I was used to large blocks of time
being dedicated to single tasks. Given a new task, I could afford to dedicate
multiple hours at a time towards thinking through and implementing a solution
in one go. I could dedicate my complete focus to the task at hand - getting
_into the zone_ - and not worry about frequent interruptions vying for my time.

After I switched over to a solutions engineer, I quickly realized that I no
longer had that luxury. What's that, you need me to implement a new React
application to enable the sales team to better understand the needs of their
clients? Sure, I can do that, just let me - oh, what's that? I need to write a
training document to teach retail-focused sales team members about some of our
new product offerings? Okay, but what do you want me to do about - oh, the CMO
of your biggest client is having a meeting right now and it's critical that a
solutions engineer joins the call? Uh, well, I....

The point illustrated above is that - as a solutions engineer - I've been
expected to handle a variety of different tasks, all of which are vying for my
attention and require different skills and mindsets to tackle. This involved
quite a lot of context switching, which prevented me from getting _into the
zone_ compared to my previous job.

### Parallel Work

As described above, my old work didn't require me to focus on too many tasks at
once.

### Prioritization

### Strengths & Weaknesses

discuss difficulties initially adapting
- many different items require parallel work
- context switching hurts focus
- hard to prioritize and evaluate time needed to accomplish tasks

## Understanding

TODO

write about quick work in building from scratch
write about slowness in integrating into existing projects; why is that?


## Planning

TODO

discuss panda planner and reference other time management videos
monthly, weekly, daily breakdown discussion
potentially show picture of planner

## Focus

TODO

discuss pomodoro technique and attempts to focus
block off time to prevent frequent intervals of disruptions

## Experiment

TODO

discuss need to never become fully complacent
- learn what works for you and keep doing that BUT
  - continue to evaluate if you can improve what you are doing that works
    e.g. I'm using panda planner, a physical notebook I need to keep around;
         is there a better way? I strong with Kanban Flow and other online
         tools; why is panda planner working so well for me? break down reasons
         and use to evaluate if other tools meet those and more
