entry. Starting a project, exercising, and even writing this blog post take
genuine effort for me to do. After realizing this as one of my biggest
obstacles to getting things done, I&rsquo;ve dedicated quite a few cycles of my time
toward figuring out ways to reduce the initial friction. For the case of taking
notes, this involved both providing a quick way to get started as well as a
comfortable environment to write notes.</p><p>For me, the speed aspect revolved around having a simple interface to launch
new notes and resume existing ones. Given that I often find myself in a
terminal during work, my focus was on using a quick command like
<code>notes blogpost</code> to start or resume a blog post.</p><p>For comfort, I sought to use vim to edit my notes. I use it for my daily
editing and prefer having the familiar modes of editing compared to launching a
plain text editor. This meant that a command like <code>notes blogpost</code> should open
vim to allow me to create/edit a file and exit in the same manner as I would
any vim file.</p><h2 id=the-solution>The Solution
<a class=heading-link href=#the-solution><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Enter the zsh function: notes. I use zsh as my shell purely out of a desire for
some more robust completion, file renaming, and prompt tweaking. Rather than
creating a separate program that would need to be installed and added to my path
on every computer I use, I decided that creating a function to be exposed by my
shell would be the simplest way to have the functionality I wanted.</p><p>The function needed to do two things: provide a standard place to store my note
files and open those files using vim. To do this, I decided that my default
location for my notes would be a hidden directory called <em>.notes</em> within my
home directory. Within that directory, each note file would have the markdown
extension of <em>.md</em>. The function itself could be provided with the name of the
note file such as <em>blogpost</em> and it would in turn open the corresponding
markdown file (e.g. <em>blogpost.md</em>).</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-zsh data-lang=zsh><span class=line><span class=cl>notes<span class=o>()</span> <span class=o>{</span>

</span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=o>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above would create the <em>.notes</em> directory if it did not exist, convert the
provided argument into a file name, and then open the file using my editor,
which was configured earlier in my <em>.zshrc</em> file as <code>export EDITOR="nvim"</code>.</p><p>From here, I could quickly jump into vim without the need to navigate to a
note-taking directory or specify the entire file including the extension. If I
wanted to work on <em>post-1</em>, I could type <code>notes post-1</code> to open the file.</p><h2 id=the-aftermath>The Aftermath
<a class=heading-link href=#the-aftermath><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Since creating that tiny function, I began tweaking and expanding what it can
do. This ranged from filling in a new file with a default header to being able
to list existing notes. Given its complexity, I&rsquo;ve decided to extract the
function and move it to its own zsh plugin, which you can find at
