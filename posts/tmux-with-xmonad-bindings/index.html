a lot for the panes and windows - something I used quite a lot with my XMonad
setup on my old Fujitsu laptop. The panes act as my individual terminals with
which I can write code, read documentation, chat on IRC (using <code class=verbatim>weechat</code> or
<code class=verbatim>irssi</code>), play music, etc. In other words, I do quite a lot from within
terminals and being able to split up a terminal into panes (like XMonad
launching tiled terminals) is quite nice. Furthermore, treating the windows as
my workspaces lets me quickly organize myself just like with XMonad.</p><p>However, the main issue I have found with tmux is with its keyboard bindings.
Everything in tmux is bound to a prefix (Ctrl-b) followed by a single keystroke
or multiple keystrokes. For instance, splitting a window into two horizontal
panes is the sequence <code class=verbatim>Ctrl-b "</code> and splitting it horizontally is <code class=verbatim>Ctrl-b %</code>. I
pride myself in being able to pick up things like this quickly, but my mind
continued to nag me about the need of a prefix as well as the use of keys like
double quotes and percent. I was used to XMonad, where creating a new pane
involved a single <code class=verbatim>Mod-Shift-Enter</code> and navigating between tiles was a simple
<code class=verbatim>Mod-Tab</code>. Because of this, I began to look into ways to rebind tmux keys to be
more like XMonad.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>The Process</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>tmux provides multiple ways to rebind keys and perform startup actions. The
first is to execute the actions from the terminal:</p><div class="src src-raw"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>tmux bind-key d kill-pane</span></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Another option is to perform the task within a running tmux instance by entering
<code class=verbatim>Ctrl-b :</code>, which enters a command mode for you to enter tmux actions.</p><p>Of course, these methods were not what I needed. What I discovered was that tmux
could source a file to get its bindings. You could have <code class=verbatim>.tmux.conf</code> within your
home directory or use</p><div class="src src-raw"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>tmux source my_tmux.conf</span></span></code></pre></div></div><p>For me, I began to work with the default <code class=verbatim>.tmux.conf</code> file. Keybindings were
easy to rebind using <code class=verbatim>bind-key</code> and <code class=verbatim>unbind-key</code>. For instance, if I wanted to
bind the space key to change the layout - XMonad uses <code class=verbatim>Mod-Space</code> by default - I
would use the following:</p><div class="src src-raw"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>bind-key Space next-layout</span></span></code></pre></div></div><p>However, a simple <code class=verbatim>bind-key</code> does not remove the prefix! This means that the
above would actually be <code class=verbatim>Ctrl-b Space</code> as the combination. Luckily, tmux
provides a way to avoid the prefix when performing actions. The <code class=verbatim>-n</code> switch
indicates that no prefix should be used.</p><div class="src src-raw"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span class=line><span class=cl>bind-key -n C-Space next-layout</span></span></code></pre></div></div><p>The above indicates that the series of keystrokes <code class=verbatim>Ctrl-Space</code> should change the
layout used in tmux, no prefix needed.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>The Issue</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>The issue I discovered was that modifier keys - Control, Shift, Function, Alt -
were not fully supported in tmux. In fact, modifier keys are not fully supported
in a lot of applications. Instead, you see certain keycodes appear when a
modifier key is used in combination with a normal key. If you execute <code class=verbatim>xmodmap</code>
in your terminal, you should get a list of modifier keys in your computer.
Entering <code class=verbatim>xmodmap -pk</code> into your terminal yields the actual table containing the
representations of each key without modifiers, with the shift key, with the mode
switch key, with the shift and mode switch keys, with the alt key, and with the
alt and shift keys. If you print this table, you'll notice that quite a few keys
do not have bindings for shift/mode switch keys.</p><p>Furthermore, after looking at tmux's source, it appears that only certain keys
are checked for modifiers before passing the keystroke to the application
running within tmux. Because of this, I cannot use a setup like
<code class=verbatim>Ctrl-Shift-Return</code> for creating a new terminal tile using standard tmux.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>The Potential Solution</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><p>At least, I did not believe that I could. I discovered that tmux provided even
more functionality through the ability to not only launch shell programs but
also check the return status of said programs!</p><div class="src src-raw"><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-mysql data-lang=mysql><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c1># Run command if system is Mac OS X
</span></span></span><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=c1></span><span class=k>if</span><span class=o>-</span><span class=n>shell</span><span class=w> </span><span class=s1>&#39;test `uname` == &#34;DARWIN&#34;&#39;</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>&lt;</span><span class=n>COMMAND</span><span class=o>&gt;</span><span class=w> </span><span class=p>[</span><span class=n>OPTIONAL</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>COMMAND</span><span class=p>]</span></span></span></code></pre></div></div><p>Because of this ability, I thought about having a small program that could be
executed to indicate whether modifier keys like control and shift were currently
being pressed down. Returning success indicates they were and returning failure
indicates they were not.</p><p>The challenge appeared when I realized that modifier keys were mostly unable to
be tracked in this manner. tmux itself was not at fault for this limitation; so,
I had to dig deeper to find out how to retrieve this bindings. I had seen some
utilities that could detect shift and control key presses, but they were bound
in the X11 system, which I did not want to impose as a restriction for my setup.
In fact, my hope was that this could be run very easily without an X11 system.
Furthermore, as a new owner of a Macbook Air - Linux will be put on it soon
enough - I wanted this to be able to work on OS X as well.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-5>The Mac OS X Solution</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-2><p>Cocoa provides the functionality to directly check if modifier keys are pressed,
which is incredibly useful. So, I simply wrote a small Cocoa application that
returns success based on the state of modifier keys. The documentation indicates
that Mac OS X v10.6+ is needed to use this functionality; so, this means my
solution will only work for Snow Leopard or higher (sorry Leopard and Tiger).</p><p>You can find the small program bundled with the main project
<a href=https://chipsenkbeil.com/software/tmux-xmonad-bindings/>here</a>.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>The Linux Solution</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><p>This took a little digging before I realized that I needed to access the
keyboard interface directly, rather than accessing information from a program.
This meant accessing <code class=verbatim>/dev/my_keyboard_interface</code>, which would vary from
computer to computer.</p><p>I wrote a small C program to demonstrate this functionality
<a href=https://chipsenkbeil.com/software/keyboard-state/>here</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, after joining IBM in January of 2014, I was not able to continue
pursuing this project.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-7 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-7>The Final Result</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-7 class=outline-text-2><p>Overall, the configuration combined with the modifier keys captured by an
external program successfully produced a working replica of XMonad's key
bindings using tmux, giving me a more comfortable layout for moving panes and
navigating.</p><p>You can find the project <a href=https://chipsenkbeil.com/software/tmux-xmonad-bindings/>here</a>.</p></div></div></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><p>©
