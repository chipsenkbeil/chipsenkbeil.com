&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re diving into setting up your Yubikey to host your GPG subkeys
created in parts &lt;a href="https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-3-encryption" >3&lt;/a>,

&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve got multiple Yubikeys configured across different devices and primarily
use them for password management and SSH authentication. Rather than keeping
physical subkeys on each of these machines, I instead have a dedicated Yubikey
for each device that hosts the subkeys, keeping them protected from direct
exposure.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Applying GPG and Yubikey: Part 5 (Authentication)</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-5-authentication/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-5-authentication/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a reminder, you can check out my &lt;a href="https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-1-overview" >overview

&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going specifically into using GPG for authentication for SSHing
into remote servers and associating with Github.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One handy use case for GPG keys related to authentication is using a GPG key to
access remote servers over SSH. Rather than using password-based authentication
or SSH public key authentication via &lt;code>ssh-keygen&lt;/code>, we can leverage a GPG key
with authentication capabilities to connect instead.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Applying GPG and Yubikey: Part 4 (Signing)</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-4-signing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-4-signing/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a reminder, you can check out &lt;a href="https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-1-overview" >overview

&lt;p>Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going specifically into using GPG for encryption and
how to integrate GPG into &lt;a href="https://passwordstore.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://neomutt.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neomutt&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At this point, we have our primary key for signing and certifying (SC) other keys.
You should also notice a second key (labelled as a subkey here) that is purely
for encryption (E). We will be using that encryption key for our utilities
today.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Applying GPG and Yubikey: Part 2 (Setup GPG Keys)</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-2-setup-primary-gpg-key/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-2-setup-primary-gpg-key/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read &lt;a href="https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-1-overview" >my overview
post&lt;/a>, feel free to check it
out to get an idea of why and how I started using GPG and Yubikey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today we&amp;rsquo;ll be diving into how to set up a new master GPG key and configure it
for use with the &lt;a href="https://passwordstore.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pass&lt;/a> utility. Additionally,
we&amp;rsquo;ll run through the process to create subkeys with the idea of eventually
storing these on Yubikeys.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Although I knew I had an old key floating around from previous use, I wanted to
start from scratch. From reading a variety of guides and documentation online, I knew that I wanted to create a new 4096-bit long RSA key. The time needed generate such a key on modern hardware is negligible and provides the maximum protection offered today. Luckily, the GPG interface has improved drastically since I first used it, so this process - and all of the processes I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss later - has been relatively painless.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Applying GPG and Yubikey: Part 1 (Overview)</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-1-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/applying-gpg-and-yubikey-part-1-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today is going to be the first in a series of posts I want to write about
applying GPG and YubiKey. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend that I am an expert on either GPG or
Yubikey. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on how I have been using GPG and a variety
of Yubikey devices to enhance my computer experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to dive into GPG and YubiKey at a high level and
explain what they are to my understanding and how I am using them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
