Earlier, I discussed my need to have method to jot down notes quickly and
comfortably on a computer. I wanted the setup to be as painless as possible
while also giving me the flexibility I desired to extend the note-taking method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Being a lightweight user of zsh - not leveraging many plugins or additional
functionality - I decided to explore writing a zsh function to be exposed in my
shell. This function&amp;#39;s goal was to manage my notes, providing functionality to
list existing notes, create new notes, and delete old notes. At the end of the
day, I arrived at a 122 line zsh function as seen

The Challenge

One of my biggest challenges to accomplishing something is the barrier to entry.
Starting a project, exercising, and even writing this blog post take genuine
effort for me to do. After realizing this as one of my biggest obstacles to
getting things done, I&amp;#39;ve dedicated quite a few cycles of my time toward
figuring out ways to reduce the initial friction. For the case of taking notes,
this involved both providing a quick way to get started as well as a comfortable
environment to write notes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
