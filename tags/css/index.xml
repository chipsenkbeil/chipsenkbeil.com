I spent two days investigating this and could not find a solution that worked.
Eventually, I gave up and added the Masonry Javascript library. My two attempts
were as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;div id="outline-container-headline-1" class="outline-2">
&lt;h2 id="headline-1">
Using CSS Columns
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>
CSS Columns enabled an easy, powerful way to spread page summaries across
multiple columns. Furthermore, you can prevent page summaries from being broken
up in the middle by using &lt;code class="verbatim">column-break-inside: avoid;&lt;/code>. However, I had no way
to order the page summaries dynamically such that the most recent summaries were
at the top (from left to right) and older summaries were found further down.
Instead, this resulted in the latest summary starting in the top left with older
summaries going down the first column and into the second, etc.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
