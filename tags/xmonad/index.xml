&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with &lt;code>tmux&lt;/code> a lot lately and have come to like it
quite a lot for the panes and windows - something I used quite a lot with my
XMonad setup on my old Fujitsu laptop. The panes act as my individual
terminals with which I can write code, read documentation, chat on IRC (using
&lt;code>weechat&lt;/code> or &lt;code>irssi&lt;/code>), play music, etc. In other words, I do quite a lot from
within terminals and being able to split up a terminal into panes (like XMonad
launching tiled terminals) is quite nice. Furthermore, treating the windows
as my workspaces lets me quickly organize myself just like with XMonad.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
