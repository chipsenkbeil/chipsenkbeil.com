The Reason

&lt;p>I&amp;#39;ve been playing around with &lt;code class="verbatim">tmux&lt;/code> a lot lately and have come to like it quite
a lot for the panes and windows - something I used quite a lot with my XMonad
setup on my old Fujitsu laptop. The panes act as my individual terminals with
which I can write code, read documentation, chat on IRC (using &lt;code class="verbatim">weechat&lt;/code> or
&lt;code class="verbatim">irssi&lt;/code>), play music, etc. In other words, I do quite a lot from within
terminals and being able to split up a terminal into panes (like XMonad
launching tiled terminals) is quite nice. Furthermore, treating the windows as
my workspaces lets me quickly organize myself just like with XMonad.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
