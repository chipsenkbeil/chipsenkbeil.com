comfortably on a computer. I wanted the setup to be as painless as possible
while also giving me the flexibility I desired to extend the note-taking
method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a lightweight user of zsh - not leveraging many plugins or additional
functionality - I decided to explore writing a zsh function to be exposed in my
shell. This function&amp;rsquo;s goal was to manage my notes, providing functionality to
list existing notes, create new notes, and delete old notes. At the end of the
day, I arrived at a 122 line zsh function as seen &lt;a href="https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/breaking-down-the-zsh-notes-function/#source-code" >at the bottom of this
post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reducing the Barrier to Entry in Note Taking</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/reducing-the-barrier-to-entry-in-note-taking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/reducing-the-barrier-to-entry-in-note-taking/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of my biggest challenges to accomplishing something is the barrier to
entry. Starting a project, exercising, and even writing this blog post take
genuine effort for me to do. After realizing this as one of my biggest
obstacles to getting things done, I&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated quite a few cycles of my time
toward figuring out ways to reduce the initial friction. For the case of taking
notes, this involved both providing a quick way to get started as well as a
comfortable environment to write notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>tmux with XMonad Bindings</title><link>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/tmux-with-xmonad-bindings/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://chipsenkbeil.com/posts/tmux-with-xmonad-bindings/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="the-reason">

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with &lt;code>tmux&lt;/code> a lot lately and have come to like it
quite a lot for the panes and windows - something I used quite a lot with my
XMonad setup on my old Fujitsu laptop. The panes act as my individual
terminals with which I can write code, read documentation, chat on IRC (using
&lt;code>weechat&lt;/code> or &lt;code>irssi&lt;/code>), play music, etc. In other words, I do quite a lot from
within terminals and being able to split up a terminal into panes (like XMonad
launching tiled terminals) is quite nice. Furthermore, treating the windows
as my workspaces lets me quickly organize myself just like with XMonad.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
