Eventually, I gave up and added the Masonry Javascript library. My two
attempts were as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="using-css-columns">
 Using CSS Columns
 &lt;a class="heading-link" href="#using-css-columns">
 &lt;i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading">&lt;/i>
 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>CSS Columns enabled an easy, powerful way to spread page summaries across
multiple columns. Furthermore, you can prevent page summaries from being
broken up in the middle by using &lt;code>column-break-inside: avoid;&lt;/code>. However, I had
no way to order the page summaries dynamically such that the most recent
summaries were at the top (from left to right) and older summaries were found
further down. Instead, this resulted in the latest summary starting in the top
left with older summaries going down the first column and into the second, etc.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
